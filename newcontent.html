					<h3 class="fisher">President of Fisher Hall</h3>
					<p>When I am on campus but not working on my schoolwork, I am generally in or around Fisher Hall. While Notre Dame does not have any greek life on campus, our dorms are single-sex, and we stay in these dorms for 3-4 years. We come to associate with our dorm, and we form a tremendous brotherhood. The men I have been fortunate enough to meet in Fisher are amazing people, and I am very proud to be representing them as their president.</p>
					<p>As president, I have many responsibilities, two of which include participating in Hall Presidents Council and planning major events for the dorm. With a staff of over 20 commissioners, my Vice President Andy Miles and I are able to plan 2 signature events and many miscellaneous events throughout the year. Our biggest event is the Fisher Regatta, which defines life in Fisher throughout the year.</p>

My other hobbies include watching baseball, football, and golf, boating, playing spikeball, and working out. My favorite thing to do is eat good meals and make great memories, because "You can't take it with you."</p>
